- Single responsibilty – class only has single responsibility

- Open-closed – “software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

- Liskov Substitution – “objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.”

- Interface Segregation – “many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface”

- Dependency Inversion – “depend on abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions”

 **Single Responsibility**

- Single responsibility
- Encapsulated in class
- Makes class more robust

 **Open/Closed Principle**

- Implementations can be changed and multiple implementations created and polymorphically substituted
- Inheritance from base classes
- Existing interface closed to modification
- New implementations must implement this interface

 **Liskov Substitution Principle**

- Substitutability for mutable objects
- S subtype of T, then T can be replaced with S

 **Interface Segregation Principle**

- No client should be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use
- ie you dont leave methods blank if you dont implement them. Instead use 2 interfaces

 **Dependency Inversion Principle**

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
