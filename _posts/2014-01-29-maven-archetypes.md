This post is more for my own information on building archetypes

I like maven archetypes as they provide a IDE independent starting point for projects. I was particularly interested in spring archetypes and found these two projects –

<https://github.com/kolorobot/spring-mvc-quickstart-archetype>

<http://code.google.com/p/spring-archetypes/>

They also serve as good examples of how to build project specific archetypes.
