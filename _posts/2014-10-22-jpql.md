“JPQL is not SQL” was one of the first things I read about JPQL – it was strange because they look very similar, and serve a similar purpose. But basically JPQL is to objects, what SQL is to tables

The following examples will work off this object model, note there is a 1:1 mapping between these Objects and the underlying tables (Diagram TBD) –

Agreement -&lt; Claims -&lt; Claim\_Lines — Instalments

\[sourcecode lang=”java”\] class Agreement {  
 private String agreementName;  
 private Integer agreementYear;  
 private List claims;  
 private User createdBy;  
} class Claim{  
 private double amount;  
 private List claimLines;  
}

class ClaimLine {  
 private Instalment instalment;  
}

class Instalment {  
 private Integer instalmentNo;  
}

class User {  
}  
\[/sourcecode\]

**Simple Queries**

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag – This will return all the data underlying he Agreement object

SELECT DISTINCT ag.agreementYear FROM Agreement ag – Return Distinct Agreement Years

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag WHERE ag.agreementYear = ‘2014’ – All agreements from this year (2014)

SELECT cl1 FROM claim cl1, claim cl2 WHERE cl1.amount &gt; cl2.amount – All claims where claim amount 1 &gt; claim amount 2

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag WHERE ag.agreementName LIKE ‘%test%’

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag WHERE ag.agreementName IS NULL

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag WHERE ag.claims IS EMPTY

**Joins**

The above queries are nice – but the real power of a query language is JOIN’s

**JOIN == INNER JOIN**

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag JOIN ag.claims cl WHERE cl.amount &gt; 1000 – Return all agreements where claim amount &gt; 1000

Equals –

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag INNER JOIN ag.claims cl WHERE cl.amount &gt; 1000 – Return all agreements where claim amount &gt; 1000

**LEFT JOIN == LEFT OUTER JOIN**

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag LEFT JOIN ag.claims cl WHERE cl.amount &gt; 1000 – Return all agreements, and claim amount &gt; 1000

Equals –

SELECT ag FROM Agreement ag LEFT OUTER JOIN ag.claims cl WHERE cl.amount &gt; 1000 – Return all agreements, and claim amount &gt; 1000

**FETCH JOIN**

A FETCH JOIN enables the fetching of an association as a side effect of the execution of a query

The effect of the FETCH is to not return the associated claims

SELECT ag FROM agreement ag LEFT JOIN FETCH ag.claims cl WHERE cl.amount = 1000

**IN**

You can use the IN object instead of a JOIN –

SELECT DISTINCT cl FROM claim cl,  
 IN(cl.claimLines) cll  
 WHERE cll.claimLineNo = 1

**EXISTS**

SELECT DISTINCT usr FROM User usr WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ag FROM Agreement agr WHERE agr.createdBy = usr)

**Bulk Update and Delete**

DELETE FROM Agreement agr;

DELETE FROM Agreement agr WHERE agr.claims IS EMPTY;

UPDATE Agreement agr SET agr.agreementYear = ‘2014’ WHERE agr.agreementYear IS NULL;
