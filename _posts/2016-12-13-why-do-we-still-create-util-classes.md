Its been niggling at me for a while, a few years even, but why do we insist on creating our own util classes like StringUtilâ€™s, DateUtilâ€™s or CollectionUtilâ€™s when we have great open source projects that contain these classes and methods? In fact recently I foolishly created a CSVUtil class instead of using [apache commons csv](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/) or [opencsv](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/)

The most common method you see is a StringUtil.isNullOrEmpty. It will be similar to â€“

```
public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String myString) {
Â Â  if (myString == null || "".equals(myString)) {
Â Â Â Â Â  return true;
Â Â  } else {
Â Â Â Â Â  return false;
Â Â  }
}
```

Its not bad code, and keeps you DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) from repeated null or empty string checks.

But the problem is â€“

- Reinventing the wheel because there are a lot of great libraries providing this util and more
- Created an artifact that you need to support, write unit tests
- Impact on code coverage â€“ if you dont unit test then you get a black mark against your code coverage
- Chance you have introduced a bug

One reason we see code like this is they are an organisational software legacy, where in the pre-Java8 world we checked for null as we didnt have Optional classes.

## What to use instead?

- [Apache Commons](http://commons.apache.org) â€“ In my experience this is the most common set of utilities, and probably closely match the util they would replace
- [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) â€“ These are newer than Apache Commons, although are now well established. The approach is slightly different and allow you to method chain. This might suit your coding style better

## Selection

The choice of library isnt as important as consistency â€“ so try not to mix apache commons in one part of the code, with the guava implementation in another part of the code. This will make future maitenance easier

## Caveat

As with all the best rules there are times when you need to break them. I would create a util class when â€“

- Specific Implementation â€“ Package Iâ€™m using doesnt contain the method I need, but I would try to use the existing util as the basis for this
- pre-Java8 â€“ I might create a util as a facade on say Dateâ€™s or because I dont have Optional
- *Procrastination* â€“ The final reason for creating the util is to procrastinate, and avoid my main task! I create the util then at least I can feel productive at my next standup ðŸ™‚

So my New Years resolution for 2017 is to stop creating these classes and use tried and tested utils, and try and replace them when I see them!
