###  Why I blog? 

My blog is my way of collecting my notes on Java and Spring technologies. I had tried everything in the past from old skool paper, word documents to evernote. But wasnâ€™t happy with the results.

Blogging proved the perfect solution as I could always access my notes, and it allowed me to share the notes and help others.

I am currently a Most Valuable Blogger on [dzone](https://dzone.com/users/438281/farrelmr.html)
